3. Sorting Data
ORDER BY: Sorts the result set in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
4. Aggregate Functions
COUNT(): Counts the number of rows.

SUM(): Adds up values in a numeric column.

AVG(): Calculates the average value.

MIN(): Finds the smallest value.

MAX(): Finds the largest value.

5. Grouping Data
